# AireHabitat

QGIS Plugin to assess the distribution of ecological environment. This code was implemented by Jennifer Benchetrit, during a training course at the [COGIT Lab](http://recherche.ign.fr/labos/cogit/). It allows the calculation of several indicators about ecological environment assessed from Land Uses about proximity between similar occupations, average surface patches and proportion of patch type.
